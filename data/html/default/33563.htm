<body>Dimension Keeper:<br>How do you do? I'm a second-generation Spicula that was woken up by the Giant's voice, and I
work to restore the Giants. My ability involves using runes to twist dimensions and join them for an instant. In other
words, I can teleport others from one place to another instantly. With this ability, I make traveling more convenient
for Spiculas who are working to recover the bodies of Giants. <br>For a small fee, I also offer my services to the
&nbsp;<font color="LEVEL">Awakened</font> who can access high-level rune language. The fees I collect will be used to
purchase enormous amount of gold required to restore the bodies of my masters. If you are Awakened, I recommend you to
use my services to travel conveniently.<br>
