Monk of Chaos:<br>
The skills that were once given to each race to balance their power have been taken back. Through the will of Chaos, you can learn the skills of other races as long as you have a Chaos Pomander. <br>
Chaos Pomander is a crystal of power that can combine anything. If you have one, you have been selected by my master to work for a balanced world.<br>
Are you ready for that world? If so, select the Revelation of Chaos, and through it a power appropriate for you.<br>
