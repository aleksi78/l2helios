<body>Hundt:<br>Ever seen <font color="LEVEL">Half-Devil Avataria</font>? <br>I have. It was a nightmare...I don't even
remember how I managed to escape. The creature's apparently around here these days, and it scares me senseless. Not that
I scare easily, mind you! I was a strapping young man once. You know. Once.
