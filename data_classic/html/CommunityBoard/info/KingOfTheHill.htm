    This event is an all vs all type and the winner is the player who is on the highest place at the last moment of the
    event.<br>
    If someone is disturbing you getting to your chosen spot, don't hesitate killing him!<br>
    In some cases you will appear next to a hill and to win you will need more luck and strategy than speed and power.
