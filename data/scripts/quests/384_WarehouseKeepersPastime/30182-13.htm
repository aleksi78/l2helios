I arranged the numbers 1 through 9 on the panel. Don't peek!<br>I've learned the hard way that I should get your payment
in advance. Some players run away when they realize that they don't stand a chance of winning the game. If you quit
during game play, you will forfeit your wager. Is this agreeable?<br>Now select 6 numbers between 1 and 9. Pick your
first number. <br>
